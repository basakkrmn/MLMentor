# Neural Networks

Neural networks are models inspired by the human brain that can learn **complex patterns** in data.

## Structure
- **Input Layer:** Accepts feature values.
- **Hidden Layers:** Intermediate layers that transform input using weights and activation functions.
- **Output Layer:** Produces predictions.

## Activation Functions
- **Sigmoid:** Outputs values between 0 and 1.
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** Outputs 0 for negative values, linear for positive.
- **Tanh:** Outputs between -1 and 1.
- **Softmax:** Outputs probabilities for multi-class classification.

## Types of Neural Networks
- **Feedforward Neural Networks:** Basic architecture with unidirectional flow.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** For image or spatial data.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** For sequential data like text or time series.
- **Autoencoders:** For unsupervised representation learning.

## Training
- Uses **backpropagation** to update weights.
- Optimizers like SGD, Adam are used.
- Loss functions (MSE, Cross-Entropy) measure error.

## Applications
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Self-driving cars
