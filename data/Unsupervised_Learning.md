# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with **unlabeled data**, meaning no target labels are provided. 
The goal is to discover patterns, structures, or groupings in the data without predefined categories.

## Key Algorithms

### Clustering
- **K-Means Clustering:** Groups data points into k clusters based on similarity.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a tree of clusters from bottom-up or top-down.

### Dimensionality Reduction
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces the number of features while preserving variance.
- Formula: `Z = X * W` where W contains the principal components.

### Anomaly Detection
- Identifies unusual observations in data.
- Example: Detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Concepts
- **Clusters:** Groups of similar data points.
- **Outliers:** Points that deviate significantly from the rest.
- **High-dimensional data:** Data with many features, often reduced with PCA or t-SNE.

## Applications
- Customer segmentation for marketing
- Market basket analysis
- Image compression
- Fraud detection in finance
