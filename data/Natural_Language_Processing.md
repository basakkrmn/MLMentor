# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Basics

NLP focuses on **understanding and processing human language**.

## Key Concepts
- **Tokenization:** Splitting text into words, sentences, or subwords.
- **Stopword Removal:** Removing common words like "the", "is", "and".
- **Stemming / Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their root form.
- **Bag of Words (BoW) / TF-IDF:** Represent text as numerical vectors.
- **Word Embeddings:** Dense vector representations (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText).

## Text Classification
- Assign categories to text (spam detection, sentiment analysis).
- Model input: vectorized text; output: category label.

## Applications
- Chatbots
- Sentiment analysis
- Text summarization
- Machine translation
